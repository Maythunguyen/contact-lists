This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a “Contacts” application that allows the user to browse their contacts.

## Project Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maythunguyen/contact-lists.git
cd contact-lists

```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
